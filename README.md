# MiamiGISIII
#### A user-selectable map showing areas in Miami that may be affected by sea level rise in the near future. Using NHGIS data from IPUMS and sea level rise and elevation data from NOAA, an interactive app was created to investigate the intersection of climate-based inequities and race and socio-economic status. 

#### This interactive map encourages viewers to toggle with the data and understand spatial patterns. While SLR affects people across race and income levels in Miami, it is more pronounced in communities of color and lower socioeconomic communities. Many public housing units seem likely unaffected by SLR. Many houses across valuation are also affected, showing that features like beachside views, which were previously considered desirable, may no longer be seen as such as SLR occurs.

#### This map is of normal sea level and does not take tides or weather events into account. Future work is necessary to understand how inequities came to be and how they will look in the future.
